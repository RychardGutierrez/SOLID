# SOLID PRINCIPLES

- Single Responsibility 
  - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality
  - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality

- Open Closed Classes 
  -should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.
  - Classes should be opne for extension, but closes for modifications.

- Liskov Substitution 
  - Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
  - This means that every sub-class or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

- Interface Segregation 
  - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can’t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
  

- Dependency Inversion 
  - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
